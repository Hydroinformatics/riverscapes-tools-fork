"""
An alternative to the original combined_fis.py, in which the FIS can be modified for sensitivity analysis.
Much of the code is copied from the original combined_fis.py.
This script is meant to be imported into brat.py and called in place of combined_fis.py.
A similar version is provided for the combined FIS.
