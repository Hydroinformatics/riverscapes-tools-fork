This test runs the pyBRAT 4 combined FIS using the PyBRAT 3 Idaho BRAT inputs. It then compares the results against the original
pyBRAT 3 results for the same reaches. In other words, this test proves that the pyBRAT 4 combined FIS routine produces the same results as the same routine for pyBRAT 3.

Test data:

* Medicine Lodge (17040215)
* Middle Salmon Chamberlain (17060207)
* Upper Hayes (17040202)
